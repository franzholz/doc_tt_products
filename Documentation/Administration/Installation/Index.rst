Installation
------------

Install the extension with the Extension Manager. If you already use an older version of tt_products that is installed in the “global” location (typo3/ext/), it is recommended to install the new extension into the “local” folder (typo3conf/ext/) without overwriting the old one. By doing this you can easily switch back to the former version.

Deinstall the extension from the Extension Manager. Then download the version of your choice from the TYPO3 Online Repository with the Extension Manager.  Then use the Extension Manager's "Available extensions to install" menu entry and add the shop system again.

This extension works best in union with static_info_tables, static_info_tables_taxes,
agency, rtehtmlarea, mbi_products_categories, transactor and taxajax.
