Weight, bulk and special preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each product can have weight (kg) and bulkily (Yes/No). The total weight is calculated and can be
used in the price calculation for the shipping costs.

If an item has been marked as 'bulkily' then a warning message will be displayed ('bulkilyWarning' in setup). By setting 'bulkilyAddition' in setup you can add an additional shipping price for this
bulkily item.  Special preparation does generally not have a function. Only a marker (like with
BulkilyWarning) will be written. You can set here a link to the mail form page.  **Example:**
