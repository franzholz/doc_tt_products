MEMO page
---------

You can add items to a memo page when a user is logged in or not. This memo page will be saved in
the fe_user table or in the FE session.   Simply create a new page with the Shop plugin as content
and enter the code "MEMO". You must set the starting point there too, like in the SEARCH pages.
