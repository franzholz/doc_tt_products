Discount:
---------

There are several methods to get a discount.

#. Use the discount field for a frontend user and enter the percent of discount.
#. Use the price2 field for special feuser groups or other things. This setting is done in TypoScript
   via the IF-statement.
#. Use the discountprice calculation where the discount depends on the value of the total number of
   the products which have a special price. This will be available for the frontend user group
   'discountGroupName'.
