AGB General Trading Conditions
------------------------------

You have to accept the general trading conditions before you can make an order and continue with the
process. A page can be defined for this with "PIDagb". The AGBs have to be displayed there. You can
set the target for a link by "AGBtarget".

A document (e.g. a PDF file) on the server containing the AGB can be set by "AGBattachment". This
will be set to the customer as an email with an attachment to the order confirmation. The shop
administration will not get this file. (he can get a CSV file of the order data instead, if wanted).
