Mini-Basket:
------------

Beside the "normal" basket which shows a complete list of added products and some order options,
there is also a "mini-basket" which only shows the number of products in the basket and the total
price. This shows or indicates the actualization of the contents of the mini-basket displayed above
the normal view (or as desired) while the process in shop steadily continues. The progress of
accumulation that the mini-basket indicates can be controlled via typoscript. To use this
mini-basket, insert a new content element "Plugin: Products" and in the display view insert 'Basket:
overview' or if you use typo3script set the CODE-field to OVERVIEW.

Use the following markers in your tt_products template to enable and customize this mini-basket:
