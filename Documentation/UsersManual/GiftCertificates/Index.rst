order a certificate that corresponds to 50 credit points (=25 Euros) to send to someone as a gift.
To redeem this gift certificate, then one must register as a shop customer and input the certificate
code. Thereby, haveing 50 credit points credited to his account. This customer can purchase a
particular product with these credit points.
