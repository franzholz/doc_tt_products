Link for products of the last X days
------------------------------------

This is practical for “What is new?” pages. Create simply a link to the SEARCH page and add
"newitemdays" as parameters.  http://www.big-typo3-shop.com/index.php?id=8&newitemdays=10  The
search result will contain all the products of the last 10 days. You have to use the plugin code
LISTNEWITEMS. You can also set the constant "**newItemDays** ".
